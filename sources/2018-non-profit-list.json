APMG changed the recurring term of its Sustaining Membership agreement from annual to monthly; now we are recording revenue from Sustainers as it is received each month instead of recording the total amount of an annual pledge from Sustainers. This change was necessary to support new gift processing technology and to meet the changing philanthropic expectations of our donors.\n\nFrom a financial reporting perspective, this change is most visible in the Consolidated Statement of Activities (page 4 of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements) and Schedule of Operating Fund and Long-term Activities (page 27 of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements), which caused a one-time $11,671,000 decrease in Individual Gifts and Membership support and Change in Net Assets line items. More information about the change is included in footnote 2 of the report (page 10 of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements). \n\nWhile this change caused a one-time reduction in revenue recorded in fiscal year 2018, it did not in any way change the actual level of support from Sustainers or affect the amount of cash flow provided by our Sustaining Members.

Neurology professionals research and treat more than 600 diseases of the brain and central nervous system, including Alzheimer’s disease, stroke, migraine, multiple sclerosis, concussion, Parkinson’s disease, and epilepsy. Brain diseases affect 1 in 6 people in the United States.\n\nThe AAN was launched in 1948 by A.B. Baker, MD, FAAN, a neurologist and professor at the University of Minnesota whose photo can be seen in the lobby holding a plastic cast showing the cerebral arteries of a brain. The mission of the AAN is to promote the highest quality patient-centered neurologic care and enhance member satisfaction. \n\nThe Academy provides lifelong education opportunities to members to keep their clinical skills sharp and capitalize on efficiencies afforded by new health care technologies. We work closely with the national academic community to promote quality education for students, medical residents, and fellows who are launching their careers in neurology, and with the certification organizations to help ensure that professionals meet the stringent requirements for providing high-quality care to patients.

of a life-saving organ transplant, gets one and patients have access to the highest quality, life-altering skin and cornea tissue,” —Susan Gunderson, LifeSource CEO \n\nAbout LifeSource \nDonation is what we do. It’s all we do. And we do it well. \nLifeSource is the non-profit organization dedicated to saving lives through organ, eye and tissue donation in the Upper Midwest. We are widely recognized as a leader in innovation and best practices for donation and transplantation. We serve more than seven million people in communities across Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and western Wisconsin.\n\nAchievements in 2017, 2018 & 2019:\nLifeSource achieved the highest level of organ donors in its 30-year history, a 22% increase in individual organ donors year-over-year and 27% increase in organs transplanted. 70% of Minnesotans documented their choice by opting-in via their driver’s license, fishing or hunting license or online as compared to the 58% national average.\n\nOur Partners in Donation\nDonation and transplant rely on broad collaboration and partners.

Volunteers of all ages join us and turn hunger into hope with their own two hands by hand-packing special meal formulas scientifically designed to meet the needs of severely malnourished children, reverse the effects of malnutrition and prevent it in the future. The meals are then shipped to an exceptional network of missions and humanitarian organizations located in nearly 70 countries around the world, and are used by schools, orphanages, clinics and feeding programs. We currently operate out of eight permanent sites: Coon Rapids, Eagan and Chanhassen, Minnesota; Aurora, Libertyville and Schaumburg, Illinois; Mesa, Arizona; and Dallas, Texas. \nWe also offer the option to host a MobilePack, which gives churches, schools, businesses and other organizations (located anywhere in the continental United States) the chance to sponsor a packing event with FMSC and help raise awareness in their own communities. The impact FMSC has through its volunteers is dynamic - the latest fiscal year ended February 2018, with 1,221,900 volunteers packing 333 million meals-our largest year yet! The goal of FMSC is to meet the needs of those who are starving now, so they can meet their own needs in the future.

Recognizing the critical need for solid science resources in our rapidly-changing world, the museum inspires science learning, break down barriers to science achievement, and create space for conversations that foster understanding. \n\nThe museum’s reach extends well beyond its location in downtown Saint Paul. With its engaging exhibits, giant screen films, and unique special events, the museum offers science fun and learning for visitors of all ages. It produces exhibits, films, and programs for museums around the world, and it has innovative initiatives underway to help all people see themselves in science. \n\nThe Science Museum is an active research institution. Staff scientists in biology, anthropology, archaeology, paleontology, earth science, and water quality conduct research here at home and in countries around the world.

The museum houses a world-class collection of more than 90,000 works of art, representing artistic traditions spanning 5,000 years.

Areas of particular depth include the arts of China and Japan. The museum’s commitment to Asian art is evident from the gallery space devoted to its display. At present, Asian art occupies 20 percent (32,200 sq. ft.) of the museum’s total gallery space (161,000 sq. ft.). Four curators oversee the presentation and growth of the collection.\nMia’s original neoclassical building, a landmark of downtown Minneapolis, designed by the preeminent New York firm McKim, Mead and White, first opened its doors in 1915. The museum expanded in 1974 with an addition designed by the late Japanese architect Kenzo Tange. In June 2006, the museum unveiled a new wing designed by Michael Graves. In 2017, Mia announced that it had hired David Chipperfield Architects, the internationally renowned architectural firm, to create a master plan for the museum. The plan will be the first step in Mia’s long-term strategy to enhance visitor experience and expand community access to the museum.\nWith its free admissions policy, Mia is an invaluable resource to its audiences, welcoming approximately 700,000 visitors of all ages each year to enjoy the wonder and beauty of art. \nDuring the 2019 fiscal year, 779,973 people visited Mia, with an additional 2.7 million “virtual visitors” exploring the museum’s collections and exhibitions via its award-winning Web site, www. artsmia.org, and reaching an additional 29.4 million via Mia’s social media sites, including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram, and Flickr.

Think Small uses leading-edge knowledge from the early childhood field to create services and tools that support and strengthen the abilities of families and early childhood professionals.\n\nPreparing Early Childhood Professionals\n•\tProfessional Development, Consultation, and Coaching: Think Small provides metro-wide professional development opportunities focused on the essential elements of high quality care. Opportunities include classes and workshops provided in English, Spanish, Hmong, Somali, Oromo, Amharic, and Karen; individual and site-based consultation and coaching support; business support to help maintain a successful childcare business; and career guidance for certification and licensing.  Enrollment in 1,130 trainings during FY17 was 15,563. We also connect providers with quality improvement grants and emergency funding for early childhood programs.\n\n•\tCommunity Outreach and Access: Think Small’s multilingual Outreach staff connect with historically underserved communities, including those in low-income neighborhoods, English Language Learners (ELL), communities of color, immigrant and refugee families, so they can fully engage in Minnesota’s early childhood care and education system. Outreach staff work to expand the reach of Think Small services and identify needs and gaps within these communities. Staff assist families and providers navigating complex government systems, connecting them to resources and services available at Think Small and other organizations. Staff provide languages translation and interpretation for ELL providers and families.\n\n•\tPublishing: A leading publisher of curriculum, management, professional development, and business resources for adults who care for, teach, and nurture young children, Redleaf Press publishes on a broad range of topics.  These products are designed to assist early childhood professionals in using stimulating, child-centered practices based on sound and proven theory about learning and child development.  Redleaf publishes between 24 and 30 new titles a year and has 287 titles in print. In FY17 over 200,000 products were distributed to customers both in the U.S. and abroad. Redleaf books are translated into 13 different languages with over 53 books in translation.  Over 50% of Redleaf’s books are available as e-books and in other digital formats.  Approximately 715,800 catalogs are mailed to customers annually.\n\n•\tLibrary:  A branch of the St. Paul Public Library the Debra S. Fish Early Childhood Library is available statewide.  Now numbering 6,148 items, the library’s collection is a part of Minnesota’s public interlibrary loan system and materials can be delivered to all local libraries.\n\nStrengthening Families\n•\tFamily Engagement: Think Small is committed to strengthening family’s access to high quality care as well as increasing their knowledge about early childhood development and preparing children for Kindergarten. Think Small Parent Powered texting delivers evidence-based texting messages to parents and caregivers, across MN, for children birth to 5 years old. These short text messages encourage parents to do fun and engaging activities with their children to increase their literacy and numeracy development as well as tips on how to be healthy.\n\n•\tInnovations: Think Small develops and supports interventions that target low-income families including addressing the achievement and opportunity gaps between white children and children of color.  We work to identify ways child care providers can engage more fully with their families in addressing the literacy gap early on. We are currently collaborating with University of MN, LENA Foundation, and Reading Corps to implement parent engagement and provider coaching to increase the literacy levels of very young children. To date we have served 23 early childhood providers and 11 parents in these initiatives.\n\n•\tScholarships and other Financial Supports: Think Small serves providers and families with targeted financial supports. Think Small administers 5,580 eligibility-based scholarships for families to enroll children in programs with Parent Aware quality ratings in Hennepin and Ramsey Counties. We administer Basic Sliding Fee Child Care Assistance for eligible low-income families in Ramsey County.\n\nCatalyzing Change\n•\tPolicy, Advocacy and Initiatives: Think Small works across the state activating field leaders and other stakeholders across systems on issues that concern our youngest children. This includes civic engagement of child care providers and parents, with an intentional focus on raising the voice of diverse cultural, refugee, and immigrant communities. To support this work, Think Small provided 30 communications to over 6,000 subscribers of our Action Center and published 50 blog posts viewed 7,243 times. In addition, Think Small participates in a variety of state and national early learning policy coalitions and workgroups.
